# noteMe

saving stuff from the web without the bloat.

## what is this?

a chrome extension. you highlight text, click, save. that's it.

## why?

because i kept losing things i wanted to remember. copying to notes apps is annoying. this just works.

## the plan

- shadow DOM so it doesn't break on any site
- glassmorphism UI cause it looks nice
- export to markdown when you need it
- no account, no cloud, just local storage
